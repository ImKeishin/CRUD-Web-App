You first need to have Python and MySql Workbench and MySQL Community Server installed !
Open a terminal and type the following two commands:

pip install mysql-connector-python
pip install flask flask-mysql-connector
cd path_to_the_cloned_repo\PythonFlask\
python -m app.main

Then the URL you need to access with your broswer is this: http://127.0.0.1:5000
